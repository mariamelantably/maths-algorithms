# Maths Algorithms

## Description
A collection of continuous and discrete mathematical algorithms, written in multiple languages. 

## Included Files
- Extended Euclids Algorithm: computes gcd of two numbers, and finds the linear combination of those numbers that gives the gcd
- Approximating with Taylor's Theorem: finds the smallest k such that exp(x) + exp(-x) is a suitably approximated by taylor's theorem, with an error (lagrainge remainder) below 10^(-15)

## Usage
For the scala algorithms, arguments are expected as command-line arguments. Python scripts can be run directly.
