# Maths Algorithms

## Description
A collection of continuous and discrete mathematical algorithms, written in multiple languages. 

## Included Files
- Extended Euclids Algorithm: computes gcd of two numbers, and finds the linear combination of those numbers that gives the gcd
- Approximating with Taylor's Theorem: finds the smallest k such that exp(x) + exp(-x) is a suitably approximated by taylor's theorem, with an error (lagrainge remainder) below 10^(-15)
- Poisson Processes: two files that use newton's method to find the variation of extinction probability with the poisson parameter in both a one-type and a two-type branching process
- Recurrences: Investigates how an unstable recurrence (with a coefficent of 0) changes with the expected and computed recurrence to show mathematical inaccuracies of floating point approximations.
- Simpsons' Rule: Investigates how the error for composite simpsons' rule for numerical integration varies with the number of strips used.
- Continuous Maths Mini Project: uses gradient descent manually to train a small model.

## Usage
For the scala algorithms, arguments are expected as command-line arguments. Python scripts can be run directly.
